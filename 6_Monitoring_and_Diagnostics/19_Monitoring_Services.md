## Monitoring Services

```
Cloudera Manager's Service Monitoring feature monitors dozens of service health and performance metrics about the
services and role instances running on your cluster.
Service Monitoring includes the following functions:
```
- Presents health and performance data in a variety of formats, including interactive charts.
- Monitors metrics against configurable thresholds.
- Generates events related to system and service health and critical log entries and makes them available for
    searching and alerting.
- Maintains a complete record of service-related actions and configuration changes.
The following topics describe how to monitor the services and role instances installed on your cluster:

### Monitoring Service Status

```
From a service page, you can monitor the status of services, manage services and roles, and more.
From a service page, you can:
```
- Monitor the status of the services running on your clusters.
- Manage the services and roles in your clusters.
- Add new services.
- Access the client configuration files generated by Cloudera Manager that enable Hadoop client users to work with
    the HDFS, MapReduce, HBase, and YARN services you added. (These configuration files are normally deployed
    automatically when you install a cluster or add a service).
- View the maintenance mode status of a cluster.

```
You can also pull down a menu from an individual service name to go directly to one of the tabs for that service to its
Status, Instances, Commands, Configuration, Audits, or Charts Library tabs.
```
#### Viewing the URLs of the Client Configuration Files

```
To allow Hadoop client users to work with the services you created, Cloudera Manager generates client configuration
files that contain the relevant configuration files with the settings from your services.
```
```
About this task
These files are deployed automatically by Cloudera Manager based on the services you have installed, when you
add a service, or when you add a Gateway role on a host. You can manually download and distribute these client
configuration files to the users of a service, if necessary.
```
```
Procedure
```
1. Go to the Status page for a cluster. (Clusterscluster name).
2. Click ActionsView Client Configuration URLs.
    The Actions button is not enabled if you are viewing status for a point of time in the past.
    A pop-up window displays links to the client configuration zip files.
3. Click a link to download a zip file.

#### Viewing the Status of a Service Instance

```
You can view the status of a service instance from the Status page or the Clusters menu.
```
```
Procedure
```
1. Click the Cloudera Manager logo to go to the Home page.
2. Access the service.
    - In the Status tab, select ClusterName ServiceName.
    - Select Clusters ClusterName ServiceName.

```
Results
The Status page opens. On the Status page you can view a variety of information about a service and its
performance.
```
#### Viewing the Health and Status of a Role Instance

```
You can view the health and status of a role instance by clicking the role instance under the Role Counts column.
If there is just one instance of this role, this opens the Status tab for the role instance.
If there are multiple instances of a role, clicking the role link under Role Counts will open the Instances tab for the
service, showing instances of the role type you have selected.
If you are viewing a point in time in the past, the Role Count links will be greyed out, but still functional. Their
behavior will depend on whether historical data is available for the role instance.

```
#### Viewing the Maintenance Mode Status of a Cluster

```
For any cluster, you can view the components (service, roles, or hosts) that are in maintenance mode.
```

```
About this task
Minimum Required Role: Cluster Administrator (also provided by Full Administrator)
```
```
Procedure
```
- From the Cloudera Manager Home page, select the cluster that you want to view the maintenance mode status for.
- Click Actions View Maintenance Mode Status....
    This pops up a dialog box that shows the components in your cluster that are in maintenance mode, and indicates
    which are in effective maintenance mode as well as those that have been explicitly placed into maintenance mode.
    From this dialog box you can select any of the components shown there and remove them from maintenance
    mode.

```
If individual services are in maintenance mode, you will see the maintenance mode icon next to the Actions
button for that service.
Note: The Actions button is not enabled if you are viewing status for a point of time in the past.
```
### Viewing Service Status.

```
You can view a summary of the status for each service.
```
```
Procedure
```
- Click the Cloudera Manager logo to go to the Home page.
- Access the status summary.
    - In the Home Status tab, if the cluster is displayed in full form, click ServiceName in a ClusterName table.
    - In the Home Status tab, click ClusterName and then click ServiceName.
    - Select Clusters ClusterName ServiceName.
    For all service types there is a Status Summary that shows, for each configured role, the overall status and health
    of the role instance(s).
       Note: Not all service types provide complete monitoring and health information. Hive, Hue, Oozie, Solr,
       and YARN only provide the basic Status Summary.

```
Each service that supports monitoring provides a set of monitoring properties where you can enable or disable
health tests and events, and set thresholds for tests and modify thresholds for the status of certain health tests.
The HDFS, MapReduce, HBase, ZooKeeper, and Flume services also provide additional information: a snapshot
of service-specific metrics, health test results, health history, and a set of charts that provide a historical view of
metrics of interest.
```
#### Viewing Past Status

```
You can expand the Time Range Selector to view historical health, status, and chart data.
The health and status information on the Status page represents the state of the service or role instance at a given
point in time. The charts (and the Logs and Events under Diagnostics) represent the time range selected on the Time
Range Selector, which defaults to the past 30 minutes. You can view health, status, and chart historical data by
expanding the Time Range Selector. Click the mini line chart under "admin" and move the time marker ( ) to a point
in the past.
```

```
When you move the time marker to a point in the past (for services and roles that support health history), the entire
Status page updates to the time selected. A Now button ( ) allows you to quickly return to the current state of
the service. The Actions menu is disabled while viewing a past status to ensure that you cannot accidentally act on
outdated status information.

Time Line
```
#### Status Summary.

```
The Status Summary shows the status of each service instance being managed by Cloudera Manager.
Even services such as Hue, Oozie, or YARN (which are not monitored by Cloudera Manager) show a status
summary. The overall status for a service is a roll-up of the health test results for the service and all its role instances.
The Status can be:
```
```
Table 2: Status
```
```
Indicator Status Description
Started with outdated
configuration
```
```
For a service, this indicates the service is running, but at least one of its roles is running
with a configuration that does not match the current configuration settings in Cloudera
Manager. For a role, this indicates a configuration change has been made that requires a
restart, and that restart has not yet occurred.
Starting The entity is starting up but is not yet running.
```
```
Stopping The entity is stopping but has not stopped yet.
```
```
Stopped The entity is stopped, as expected.
```
```
Down The entity is not running, but it is expected to be running.
```
```
History not available Cloudera Manager is in historical mode, and the entity does not have historical
monitoring support. This is the case for services other than HDFS, MapReduce and
HBase such as ZooKeeper, Oozie, and Hue.
None The entity does not have a status. For example, it is not something that can be running
and it cannot have health. Examples are the HDFS Balancer (which runs from the HDFS
Rebalance action) or Gateway roles. The Start and Stop commands are not applicable to
these instances.
Good health The entity is running with good health. For a specific health test, the returned result is
normal or within the acceptable range. For a role or service, this means all health tests for
that role or service are Good.
```
```
Concerning health The entity is running with concerning health. For a specific health test, the returned result
indicates a potential problem. Typically this means the test result has gone above (or
below) a configured Warning threshold. For a role or service, this means that at least one
health test is Concerning.
Bad health The entity is running with bad health. For a specific health test, the test failed, or the
returned result indicates a serious problem. Typically this means the test result has gone
above (or below) a configured Critical threshold. For a role or service, this means that at
least one health test is Bad.
Disabled health The entity is running, but all of its health tests are disabled.
```
```
Unknown health The status of a service or role instance is unknown. This can occur for a number of
reasons, such as the Service Monitor is not running, or connectivity to the Agent doing
the health monitoring has been lost.
```
```
To see the status of one or more role instances, click the role type link under Status Summary. If there is a single
instance of the role type, the link directs you to the Status page of the role instance.
```

```
If there are multiple role instances (such as for DataNodes, TaskTrackers, and RegionServers), the role type link
directs you to the Role Instances page for that role type. Click on each instance, under Role Type, to be taken to the
corresponding Status page.
To display the results for each health test that applies to this role type, expand the Health Tests filter on the left and
expand Good Health, Warnings, Bad Health, or Disabled Health. Health test results that have been filtered out by
your role type selection appear as unavailable.

```
#### Service Summary

```
Some services (specifically HDFS, MapReduce, HBase, Flume, and ZooKeeper) provide additional statistics about
their operation and performance. These are shown in a Summary panel at the left side of the page.
The contents of this panel depend on the service:
```
- The HDFS Summary shows disk space usage.
- The MapReduce Summary shows statistics on slot usage, jobs and so on.
- The Flume Summary provides a link to a page of Flume metric details.
- The ZooKeeper Summary provides links to the ZooKeeper role instances (nodes) as well as Zxid information if
    you have a ZooKeeper Quorum (multiple ZooKeeper servers).
For example:

```
Other services such as Hue, Oozie, Impala, and Cloudera Manager itself, do not provide a Service Summary.
```
#### Health Tests and Health History

```
The Health Tests panel shows health test results in an expandable and collapsible list, typically with the specific
metrics that the test returned. You can Expand All or Collapse All from the links at the upper right of the Health Tests
panel.
The Health Tests and Health History panels appear for HDFS, MapReduce, HBase, Flume, Impala, ZooKeeper, and
the Cloudera Manager Service. Other services such as Hue, Oozie, and YARN do not provide a Health Test panel.
```
- The color of the text (and the background color of the field) for a Health Test result indicates the status of the
    results. The tests are sorted by their health status – Good, Concerning, Bad, or Disabled. The entries are collapsed
    by default. Click the arrow to the left of an entry to expand the entry and display further information.
- Clicking the Details link for a health test displays further information about the test, such as the meaning of the
    test and its possible results, suggestions for actions you can take or how to make configuration changes related to
    the test. The help text may include a link to the relevant monitoring configuration section for the service.


- In the Health Tests panel:
    - Clicking displays the lists of health tests that contributed to the health test.
    - Clicking the Details link displays further information about the health test.
- In the Health History panel:
    - Clicking displays the lists of health tests that contributed to the health history.
    - Clicking the Show link moves the time range to the historical time period.

#### The Actions Menu..................................................................................................................................

```
The Actions menu provides a list of commands relevant to the role type you are viewing. These commands typically
include Stopping, Starting, or Restarting the role instance, accessing the Web UI for the role, and may include many
other commands, depending on the role you are viewing.
Minimum Required Role: Operator (also provided by Configurator, Cluster Administrator, Limited Cluster
Administrator , and Full Administrator)
The Actions menu is available from the Role Status page only when you are viewing Current time status. The menu is
disabled if you are viewing a point of time in the past.
```
#### Viewing Past Status................................................................................................................................

```
You can expand the Time Range Selector to view historical health, status, and chart data.
The status and health information shown on this page represents the state of the service or role instance at a given
point in time. The exceptions are the charts tabs, which show information for the time range currently selected on the
Time Range Selector, which defaults to the past 30 minutes. By default, the information shown on this page is for the
current time. You can view status for a past point in time by moving the time marker ( ) to a point in the past.
When you move the time marker to a point in the past (for Services/Roles that support health history), the Health
Status clearly indicates that it is referring to a past time. A Now button ( ) enables you to quickly switch to view
the current state of the service. In addition, the Actions menu is disabled while you are viewing status in the past – to

### Running Diagnostic Commands for Roles

```
You can run diagnostic utility tools such as "collect stack traces" and "heap dump" against most role processes.
```
```
About this task
Minimum Required Role: Cluster Administrator (also provided by Full Administrator)
Cloudera Manager allows administrators to run the following diagnostic utility tools against most Java-based role
processes:
```
- List Open Files (lsof) - Lists the open files of the process.
- Collect Stack Traces (jstack) - Captures Java thread stack traces for the process.
- Heap Dump (jmap) - Captures a heap dump for the process.
- Heap Histogram (jmap -histo) - Produces a histogram of the heap for the process.


```
These commands are found on the Actions menu of the Cloudera Manager page for the instance of the role. For
example, to run diagnostics commands for the HDFS active NameNode, perform these steps:
```
```
Procedure
```
1. Click the HDFS service on the HomeStatus tab or select it on the Clusters menu.
2. Click InstancesNameNode (Active).
3. Click the Actions menu.
4. Choose one of the diagnostics commands listed in the lower section of the menu.
5. Click the button in the confirmation dialog box to confirm your choice.
6. When the command is executed, click Download Result Data and save the file to view the command output.

### Periodic Stacks Collection

```
Periodic stacks collection allows you to enable and configure the periodic collection of thread stack traces in Cloudera
Manager.
When stacks collection is enabled for a role, call stacks are output to a log file at regular intervals. The logs can help
with diagnosis of performance issues such as deadlock, slow processing, or excessive numbers of threads.
Stacks collection may impact performance for the processes being collected as well as other processes on the host,
and is turned off by default. For troubleshooting performance issues, you may be asked by Cloudera Support to
enable stacks collection and send the resulting logs to Cloudera for analysis.
Stacks collection is available for the majority of roles in Cloudera Manager. For the HDFS service, for example,
you can enable stacks collection for the DataNode, NameNode, Failover Controller, HttpFS, JournalNode, and NFS
Gateway. If the Stacks Collection category does not appear in the role's configuration settings, the feature is not
available for that role.
```
#### Configuring Periodic Stacks Collection.................................................................................................

```
You can enable and configure periodic stacks collection.
```
```
About this task
Minimum Required Role: Configurator (also provided by Cluster Administrator, Limited Cluster Administrator , and
Full Administrator)
```
```
Procedure
```
1. Open the Cloudera Manager page for a specific service or role.
2. Access the configuration settings in one of the following ways:
    - a. From the service page in Cloudera Manager, click the Configuration tab.
       b. Select Scope NameNode.
       c. Select Category Stacks Collection.
    - a. From the service page in Cloudera Manager, click the Instances tab.
       b. Click the Configuration tab.
       c. Select Scope role type.
       d. Select Category Stacks Collection.
The configuration settings are as follows:
- Stacks Collection Enabled - Whether or not periodic stacks collection is enabled.
- Stacks Collection Directory - The directory in which stack logs will be placed. If not set, stacks will be logged into
    a stacks subdirectory of the role's log directory.
- Stacks Collection Frequency - The frequency with which stacks will be collected.

- Stacks Collection Data Retention - The amount of stacks data that will be retained. When the retention limit is
    reached, the oldest data will be deleted.
- Stacks Collection Method - The method that will be used to collect stacks. The jstack option involves periodically
    running the jstack command against the role's daemon process. The servlet method is available for those roles
    with an HTTP server endpoint that exposes the current stacks traces of all threads. When the servlet method is
    selected, that HTTP endpoint is periodically scraped.
Example
As an example, to configure stacks collection for an HDFS NameNode, complete the following steps:
- Go to the HDFS service page.
- Click the Configuration tab.
- Select Scope NameNode.
- Select Category Stacks Collection.
- Locate the property or search for it by typing its name in the Search box.
- Modify the configuration settings if desired.
- Click Save Changes.
Stacks collection configuration settings are stored in a per-role configuration file called cloudera-stacks-monitor.prop
erties. Cloudera Manager reads the configuration file and coordinates stack collection. Changes to the configuration
settings take effect after a short delay. It is not necessary to restart the role.

#### Viewing and Downloading Stacks Logs

```
Stacks are collected and logged to a compressed, rotated log file. You can view and download stacks logs.
```
```
About this task
A certain amount of the log data is in an uncompressed file. When that file reaches a limit, the file is rotated and
bzip2 compressed. Once the total number of files exceeds the configured retention limit, the oldest files are deleted.
Collected stacks data is available for download through the Cloudera Manager UI and API. To view or download
stacks logs through the UI, complete the following steps:
```
```
Procedure
```
- On the service page, click the Instances tab.
- Click the role in the Role Type column.
- Click the Stacks Logs tab.
- Click Stacks Log File to view the most recent stacks file. Click Download Stacks Logs to download a zipped
    bundle of the stacks logs.

### Viewing Running and Recent Commands

```
#### Viewing Running and Recent Commands for a Service or Role

```
You can view running and recent commands for a service or role instance in the Commands tab.
```
```
About this task
For a selected service or role instance, the Commands tab shows which commands are running or have been run
for that instance, and what the status, progress, and results are. For example, if you go to the HDFS service shortly
after you have installed your cluster and look at the Commands tab, you will see recent commands that created the
directories, started the HDFS role instances (the NameNode, Secondary NameNode, and DataNode instances), and
the command that initially formatted HDFS on the NameNode. This information is useful if a service or role seems
to be taking a long time to start up or shut down, or if services or roles are not running or do not appear to have been
started correctly. You can view both the status and progress of currently running commands, as well as the status and
results of commands run in the past.
```
```
Procedure
```
1. Click the Clusters tab on the top navigation bar.
2. Click the service name to go to the Status tab for that service.
3. For a role instance, click the Instances tab and select the role instance name to go to its Status tab.
4. Click the Commands tab.

#### Command Details

```
You can view command details. The details available for a command depend on whether the command is running or
recently completed.
```
```
Running Commands
The Running Commands area shows commands that are in progress.
While the status of the command is In Progress, an Abort button displays so that you can abort the command if
necessary.
The Commands status information is updated automatically while the command is running.
After the command has finished running (all its subcommands have finished), the status is updated, the Abort buttons
disappear, and the information for Recent Commands appears as described below.
```
```
Recent Commands
The Recent Commands area shows commands that were run and finished within the search time range you specified.
If no commands were run during the selected time range, you can double the time range selection by clicking the Try
expanding the time range selection link. If you are in the "current time" mode, the beginning time will move; if you
```

```
are looking at a time range in the past, both the beginning and ending times of the range are changed. You can also
change the time range using the options described in the topic Time Line.
Select a value from the pager
```
```
to control how many
commands are listed, or click the arrows to view pages.
Commands are shown with the most recent ones at the top.
The icon associated with the status (which typically includes the time that the command finished) plus the result
message tells you whether the command succeeded or failed. If the command failed, it indicates if it was one of
the subcommands that actually failed. In many cases, multiple subcommands result from the top level command.
The First Run command runs during the initial startup of your cluster. Click this link to view the command history of
the cluster startup.
```
```
Command Details
In the Running Commands dialog box or Recent Commands page, click a command in the Command column to
display its details and any subcommands. The page title is the name of the command.
The Summary section at the top shows information about the command:
```
- The current status
- The context, which can be a cluster, service, host, or role
- The time the command started
- The duration of the command
- A message about the command completion
- If the context is a role, links to role instance logs
The Details section shows how many steps, if any, the selected command has and lists any subcommands.
Expand a command to view subcommands. In the Running Commands dialog box, each subcommand also has an
Abort button that is present as long as the subcommand is in progress.
You can perform the following actions:
- Select the option to display all the subcommands or only failed or running commands.
- Click the link in the Context column to go to the Status page for the component (host, service, or role instance) to
    which this command is related.
- Click a Role Log tab to display the log for that role, and stdout and stderr if available for the role.
