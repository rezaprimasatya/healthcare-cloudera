### General Notes

- **UUIDs as Strings**: In these examples, UUIDs are represented as strings (`STRING` type) since Hive does not have a native UUID type.
- **ORC File Format**: The ORC file format is used for its efficient, columnar storage and performance benefits.
- **Transactional Tables**: The `TBLPROPERTIES` is set to `"transactional"="true"` to enable ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties on the table, which is useful for updates and deletes.
- **Bucketing**: Each table is clustered into a number of buckets (10 in these examples), which can help in distributing the data evenly across the cluster and improving query performance.


### 1. Patient Information

```sql
CREATE TABLE PatientInformation (
    PatientID STRING, 
    Name STRING,
    DateOfBirth DATE,
    Gender CHAR(1),
    Address STRING,
    ContactNumber STRING,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
)
CLUSTERED BY (PatientID) INTO 10 BUCKETS
STORED AS ORC 
TBLPROPERTIES ("transactional"="true");
```

- **Indexes**: Hive doesn't support traditional indexes. Instead, you use columnar file formats like ORC to optimize for read performance.
- **Clustering**: This table is clustered by `PatientID` to ensure that data for each patient is stored together, which can improve query performance.
- **Partitioning**: Not applied here as patient data is typically not time-based. However, if there's a specific query pattern, partitioning can be considered.

### 2. Doctor Information

```sql
CREATE TABLE DoctorInformation (
    DoctorID STRING, 
    Name STRING,
    Specialty STRING,
    ContactNumber STRING,
    Department STRING,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
)
CLUSTERED BY (DoctorID) INTO 10 BUCKETS
STORED AS ORC 
TBLPROPERTIES ("transactional"="true");
```

- **Clustering**: Clustering by `DoctorID` is used for similar reasons as in the patient table.
- **Partitioning**: Like the Patient table, partitioning is not added here but can be considered based on specific query needs.

### 3. Appointment

```sql
CREATE TABLE Appointment (
    AppointmentID STRING,
    PatientID STRING,
    DoctorID STRING,
    AppointmentDate TIMESTAMP,
    ReasonForVisit STRING,
    AppointmentStatus STRING,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,

)
PARTITIONED BY (year INT, month INT, day INT)
CLUSTERED BY (AppointmentID) INTO 10 BUCKETS
STORED AS ORC 
TBLPROPERTIES ("transactional"="true");
```

- **Partitioning**: This table is partitioned by year, month, and day of the `AppointmentDate`. This approach is beneficial for queries that are filtered by date ranges.
- **Clustering**: Clustering by `AppointmentID` to group all data related to a particular appointment together.

Creating tables for "Medical Records", "Medication", and "Prescription" in a Hue environment, which typically interfaces with Hive, involves considering specific aspects such as partitioning and clustering for optimized query performance. Hive does not support traditional indexing like relational databases, so the design focuses more on how data is stored and accessed.

In this advanced query:

- We aggregate data in the fact table to provide summary information, like visit counts and average billing amounts for patients.
- We create advanced analytical views (`PatientVisitSummary`) that can be used for reporting and analytics.
- We continue to optimize the data warehouse by creating indexes and optionally partitioning or clustering the data.
- We use `COALESCE` to handle NULL values in date columns, ensuring they have valid default values.
- We group the fact table data by relevant dimensions for aggregation.

Please adapt and customize this query based on your specific data warehouse requirements and performance considerations.

Creating advanced, complex, and robust data marts and cubes using materialized views in Hue involves optimizing query performance, adding more advanced analytics, and ensuring data freshness. Below is a more detailed and advanced Hue query for generating multiple deep data marts and cubes:

```sql
-- Create the first deep data mart using a materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS DataMart1 AS

    P.PatientID,
    P.PatientName,
    D.DoctorID,
    D.DoctorName,
    M.MedicalVisitDate,
    M.MedicalDiagnosis,
    SUM(B.BillingTotalAmount) AS TotalBillingAmount,
    AVG(F.FinanceTotalAmount) AS AvgFinanceAmount,
    MAX(M.MedicalTreatment) AS MostCommonTreatment
FROM
    FactTable AS F
JOIN
    DimensionPatient AS P ON F.PatientName = P.PatientName
JOIN
    DimensionDoctor AS D ON F.DoctorName = D.DoctorName
JOIN
    DimensionMedical AS M ON F.MedicalVisitDate = M.MedicalVisitDate
GROUP BY
    P.PatientID,
    P.PatientName,
    D.DoctorID,
    D.DoctorName,
    M.MedicalVisitDate,
    M.MedicalDiagnosis;

-- Create the second deep data mart using a materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS DataMart2 AS

    FactTable AS F
JOIN
    DimensionPatient AS P ON F.PatientName = P.PatientName
JOIN
    DimensionMedical AS M ON F.MedicalVisitDate = M.MedicalVisitDate
GROUP BY
    P.PatientID,
    P.PatientName,
    M.MedicalVisitDate;

-- Create the first deep cube using a materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS Cube1 AS

FROM
    FactTable AS F
JOIN
    DimensionPatient AS P ON F.PatientName = P.PatientName
JOIN
    DimensionDoctor AS D ON F.DoctorName = D.DoctorName
JOIN
    DimensionMedical AS M ON F.MedicalVisitDate = M.MedicalVisitDate

    D.DoctorID,
    D.DoctorName,
    M.MedicalVisitDate,
    M.MedicalDiagnosis,
    F.BillingPaymentStatus
WITH CUBE;

-- Create the second deep cube using a materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS Cube2 AS
SELECT
    D.DoctorID,
    D.DoctorName,
    M.MedicalVisitDate,
    M.MedicalDiagnosis,
    P.Gender,
    COUNT(*) AS VisitCount,
    SUM(F.BillingTotalAmount) AS TotalBillingAmount
FROM
    FactTable AS F
JOIN
    DimensionDoctor AS D ON F.DoctorName = D.DoctorName
JOIN
    DimensionMedical AS M ON F.MedicalVisitDate = M.MedicalVisitDate

    DimensionPatient AS P ON F.PatientName = P.PatientName
GROUP BY
    D.DoctorID,

    P.Gender
WITH ROLLUP;

-- Refresh the materialized views to populate them with data
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW DataMart1;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW DataMart2;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW Cube1;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW Cube2;
```

In this advanced query:

- We join the fact table with dimension tables to enrich the data marts and cubes with additional attributes.
- Aggregation functions, such as `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, and `MIN`, are used to calculate various metrics.
- We use the `WITH CUBE` and `WITH ROLLUP` clauses to create advanced cubes with multiple dimensions.
- Data marts and cubes include more detailed attributes and metrics, providing a richer analytical environment.
- The `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` statements ensure that the materialized views are updated with the latest data.

Please adapt and customize this query to your specific data mart and cube requirements, including the dimensions, metrics, and aggregations that are relevant to your healthcare analytics.
